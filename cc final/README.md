#Overview for final project

--> Need to click somewhere on the screen to start the audio

I wanted to make a music visualizer sort of inspired by the galaxy. This means I needed to figure out how to 
analyze the beats and frequency in a song to affect particles, or stars in my case. I used the p5.sound and p5.FFT libraries to do this. 

#Some of the math stuff I had to look up and it was a learning curve to use these libraries because I've never done anything wih a song and code
before. 

I had the initial issue of not having any audio and getting an error message in the console because the audio file couldn't be played 
without user interaction, which I didn't know. Once I looked up how to fix that error I got the audio to play.
