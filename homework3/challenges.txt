I think in terms of challenges a lot of what I've overcome, especially in recent years, has been internal. I'm fairly shy and not a very social person, particularly in large groups or with new people. So going to classes on the first day, starting my job, and really anything to do with new people is a challenge to me. I think I've started to overcome this by forcing myself to get out of my comfort zone and try new things. Even when it scares me I've started forcing myself to get out there more. It has gotten easier, slowly though.
